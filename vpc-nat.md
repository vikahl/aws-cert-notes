# NAT instances & NAT gateways

- Solves the problem of instances in the private net needing to communicate out to Internet (for example to do updates)

## NAT instances

NAT instances are launched as ec2, search for _nat_ under _Community AMIs_. More information can be found in Amazon NAT instance help.

- Launch into public subnet
- Disable _source/destination check_
- Create route in main route table, destination: `0.0.0.0/0` -> instance (nat instance)

Not ideal solution, one single instance handles all forwarding and if that instance is crashed (overloaded, terminated, â€¦) outbound connections will no longer work.
Possible to account of bottleneck issues by creating high availability using autoscaling groups, multiple subnets in different AZ's and scripts to automate failovers.

## NAT gateway

Better solution to NAT instance.

- Redundant inside AZ
- No need to patch/update the os
- Not associated with security groups and automatically assigned a public ip
- No need to disable source/destination checks
- Note: if resources in multiple AZ share one NAT gateway, in the event of the NAT gateways AZ is down, all instances will lose Internet access.  
  To create an AZ-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each AZ (and configure the routing to use the GW in same AZ)

Create new NAT gateway

- Create NAT gateway (under NAT gateways)
- Create route table entry `0.0.0.0/0 -> nat gateway`
