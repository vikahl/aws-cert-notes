# AWS S3

_Simple, storage service_

IMPORTANT: Read the S3 FAQ before the exam, S3 takes up a large part of the exam.

- Object based â€• i.e. allows for uploading files
  - key: name of the object
  - value: data, made up of a sequence of bytes
  - version id, used for versioning
  - metadata
  - subresources
    - access control list (permissions to that object)
- Files can be from 0 b to 5 Tb
- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets (folders) in an global namespace
- Uploads returns a HTTP 200

_An alternative to object based storage is block based storage which can be used to install operating systems, databases et c.
S3 only support object based storage._

## Data consistency for S3

- Read after write consistency for new objects (PUT)
- Eventual consistency for overwrite (PUT) and deletes (DELETE), can take some time to propagate.  
  Means that if a file is updated/deleted and read immediately, you might get the new one or you might get the old one.

- 11 x 9s, Amazon guarantees 99.99999999999% durability for the information

## Features of S3

- Tiered storage available
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- MFA delete
- Data is secured by Access control lists (ACL) and Bucket policies

## S3 storage classes

IMPORTANT: to know about the different storage classes and the usage.

- Standard, 99.99% availability, 11x9 durability  
  Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and designed to sustain the loss of two facilities concurrently
- Infrequently accessed (IA)  
  For data access less frequenctly, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee, but charges retrieval fee.
- One zone infrequently accessed  
  Lower-cost option for IA data and do not require the multiple availability zone data resilience.
- Intelligent tiering (released in 2018)  
  Optimizing costs by using machine learning to move the data between tiers.
- Glacier  
  Secure, durable and low-cost storage. Can reliably store any amount of data at low cost, and with retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
- Glacier deep archive  
  Lowest cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

## S3 billing and charging

- Storage
- Requests
- Storage management pricing
- Data transfer pricing
- Transfer acceleration  
  Uses CloudFront for fast, easy and secure transfer of files over long distances to end users.
- Cross region replication pricing  
  Replicate objects from one bucket to another in different regions (from US to AUS for example)

## S3 transfer acceleration and caching

- Transfer acceleration utilises the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate uploads to S3.  
  Instead of uploading directly to the bucket, a distinct url to upload to an edge location is used, which will then be transfered to the bucket.
- Speedtest tool to check which regions that are fastest to your current location.
